# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
* V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
 
Using the Pandas groupby() function with the count() and sum() methods on PyBer DataFrame columns, get the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. Then, calculate the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type. Finally, add this data to a new DataFrame, then format the columns and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

### Flexible fare model and drivers compensation based on city type: 

1)Time centric (Urban)

2)Distance centric (Rural) 

3)Balanced Distance + Time (Suburban)

"Additional analysis focusing on the above needs to be conducted to support a fair driver compensation program that maintain competitive fares for the users"
